# warp7-php8.0

YooTheme Warp 7 Wordpress Theme Framework, made compatible for php 8.0

The Theme and framework are developed by YOOtheme GmbH (http://www.yootheme.com).

Recently the support and maintenance for the Warp 7 themes has been dropped.
This created a vacuum in terms of providing support for the older themes and created uncertainty for the website owners and developers who relied on Warp 7.

Although it has been around for many years, Warp 7 framework still offers quite many advantages when developing new progects, namely the ability to create easy overrides for the theme, creating multiple layouts per project, adjusting content visibility, etc.

Within the repository you will find the php 8.0 compatible Master 2 Wordpress theme, based on the latest Warp Theme Framework 7.3.37.

You can easily port the patched to the Joomla theme as well.

This repository will be maintained in the following months, so feel free to submit your suggestions and questions.
